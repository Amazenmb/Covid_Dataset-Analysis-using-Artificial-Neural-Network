'''
The dataset has 6 columns in total, with 5 columns for features and 1 column for output. 
The features are:
Age(Num)
body_temperature(str)
chronic_disease(str)
breathing_issue (str)
Blood O2 Level in Percentage(Num)
Needed Hospitalization(str) - Output

In case of any missing data, we will use SimpleImputer library to fill it with the data based on strategy. For numeric, strategy will be mean.
Here, if you check the dataset, the missing values are for Age and Blood O2 level, hence we will use these columns only i.e., 0 and 4. The transformed array by
Panda will be having np.nan wherever values are missing.
'''

imputer=sklearn.SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')

#X[:,0:5:4] means dat to be picked from 0th to 5th column with an interval of 4
imputer.fit(X[:,0:5:4])
X[:,0:5:4] = imputer.transform(X[:,0:5:4])
