'''
The dataset has 6 columns in total, with 5 columns for features and 1 column for output. 
The features are:
Age(Num)
body_temperature(str)
chronic_disease(str)
breathing_issue (str)
Blood O2 Level in Percentage(Num)
Needed Hospitalization(str)

As the machine learning algorithm will not understand the string value for required computation,
we will have to assign some numerical values to each of the string valued columns. For example, in body_temperature,
there are 3 categories: Normal, Moderate and High. So, for a person having moderate body temperature, it can be assigned
010. As it is understood, the categorical encoding will result in 3 columns for body temperature each representing Normal, Moderate and High body temperature

'''
For encoding of categorical features or independent variables:
OneHotEncoder transforms each categorical feature with n_categories possible values into n_categories binary features, with one of them 1, and all others 0.
'''

ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[('encoder',OneHotEncoder(), [1])], remainder= 'passthrough')
X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X))

#For encoding of label
le = LabelEncoder()
y = le.fit_transform(y)
