#Upload the dataset into current folder and then import

#Read .csv file and load into panda dataframe

#X is the set of inputs or independent variables or features. In the dataset, except the last column, all are input variables or features hence splitting the dataset accordingly.

#Y is the output.  This is to be predicted based on the features
